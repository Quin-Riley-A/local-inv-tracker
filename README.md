## Repository Description
This project was written and compiled in C-Sharp. It will initially welcome the user to a splash page and prompt them to log in. Upon logging in, the user will be able view, add to and remove both various teas and edit their quantities and features. Each baked-good contains a name, a brief description and an associated set of flavors. Flavors and baked-goods can be associated in a series of many to many relationships.

This project was hand-built in tandem with a class by Epicodus, a remote school for programming. It contains use the technologies and programs listed below.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- JSX
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Node
- Git
- Github
- Markdown
- VS Code


## Installation And Setup
1. Clone a copy of this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project's root directory in the terminal
3. Install dependencies by entering the following command :
```bash 
npm install
```
4. Use the commands below to start the application 

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Known Bugs
- Program appears to be void of CRUD functionality based bugs
  - When updating code 
- Program styling is currently extremely minimal
